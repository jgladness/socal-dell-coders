# socal-dell-coders
SoCal - App-Dev/Deep Learning Project
1.	Become semi-proficient with Python through Online Python Instruction
  a. Coursera Python for Everybody:   https://www.coursera.org/learn/python 
2.	Deploy PCF in Persistent Lab Environment
3.	Create Web-based App on PCF to Collect Images for later processing by Deep Learning algorithm
  a.	Upload pictures with categorization tags 
  b.	Reformat pictures normalized resolution for Deep Learning existing data set into ECS Object storage
  c.	(optional) Auto-Scale new instances depending on load
  d.	(optional) Load Balancing to front end
4.	Train Deep Learning model on existing and new Pictures based on categorization tags
  a.	Build CPU-based TensorFlow training exercise to model new data sets
5.	Deploy new Web-based App on PCF to infer new pictures
